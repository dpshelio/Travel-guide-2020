# Tokyo

Tokyo is a very beautiful city. I would love to go to Ginza, which is the largest business area both for working and for entertainment. I really hope to taste Kobe beef in the restaurant in Ginza even if the price is high. Eating the beef together with watching Olympic Games is very enjoyable.
