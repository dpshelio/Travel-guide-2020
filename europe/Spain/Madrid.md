# Madrid

Bustling, energetic, vibrant... 
Madrid churns with energy as only a capital city could. 
From Puerta del Sol and the Gran Vía boulevard to Plaza de España, Malasaña, Chueca and the Real Madrid stadium, 
it's not sheer multitude that makes the city stir. 
It's the madrileño attitude -- a zest for socializing,
taking to the streets and cheerfully maximizing every hour not spent working.
