# Adding Trabzon to List
Trabzon has just returned on the tourist radar, and the city is still investing in tourist infrastructure.
Like a few other Turkish cities like Istanbul and Izmir
, Trabzon is culturally located somewhat in between Anatolia and Eastern Europe.
 In the case of Trabzon this is due to the Pontic Mountains,
 which used to form a cultural barrier. Coming from the Anatolian heartland,
 it feels like one is entering Europe, while coming from the Caucasus,
 Trabzon comes across as the first city with Middle-Eastern influences.
 Tourists who visit Trabzon come mostly from a few countries: nearby Georgia,
 Russia, the Netherlands, Germany, Greece, Azerbaijan, New Zealand and the Gulf states.
