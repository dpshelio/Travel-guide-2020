# Cayman Islands

It is strange that there are islands in the Caribbean sea under UK authority. Actually, there are three islands ( Grand Cayman, Little Cayman, Cayman Brac) and each one has a different story to tell. Definately, I would like to do Scuba Diving or laying for hours on the Seven Mile Beach, one of the most beautiful beaches in the world. Last but not least, I'd love to visit Tortuga rum factory in order to learn how rum is made and purchase a bottle of original Caribbean rum for my mojitos.
