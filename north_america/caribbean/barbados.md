# Barbados

I want to explore a new island and I had planned a holiday there that was cancelled due to COVID. They have beautiful beaches, good food and great weather - what more do I need ...
I also like the music and culture across the Caribbean. I've visited two other islands already but the more the merrier :)
Hopefully I get to go in 2021 ...
