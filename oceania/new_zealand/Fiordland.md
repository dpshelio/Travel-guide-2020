# Fiordland

I was in New Zealand about to travel around the whole country just before covid-19.
This trapped me in Christchurch for 3 weeks waiting to get a flight home. The Fiordland 
looks amazing and was what I was looking forward to most, so I would love to go back there
when this is over to see this amazing place!
